                    <h3>What I was able to finish</h3>
                    <p>I was able to complete most of the functions that were required. I was able to complete everything except for 12,14,15 and 16 of the documentation which was the author functionality, highest average rating feature, recommendation feature and custom functionality.</p><br>

                    <h3>Reflection of the process</h3>
                    <p>After finishing the first assignment, I feel like it was much easier to plan out the second one even though it was much larger in scale. I read through the document sheet once and then wrote out a list of view pages I know I need. I already wrote out the controllers + the functions I would need to link them to the view pages. The only thing I did on the fly was the migrations and seeds as I wanted to finish all the basic functions first in the web application before I started on the advanced ones which had changes to the database and extra classes to implement. I regularly test all functions as soon as I wrote them to make sure they were functioning. I solved problems I came across by testing different solutions I searched on the web however I think that I should have moved to a different part when I got stuck as sometimes I spent hours trying to figure out one insignificant part of the website when I could have used that time more efficiently somewhere else. I think a smarter plan next time is to finish all the less time consuming parts then do the more time consuming parts later.</p>
